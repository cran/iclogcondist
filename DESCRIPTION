Description: We consider the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimation of the underlying distribution function, assuming log-concavity, based on mixed-case interval-censored data. The algorithm implemented is base on Chi Wing Chu, Hok Kan Ling and Chaoyu Yuan (2024, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2411.19878>).
