\arguments{
\item{phi_tilde_initial}{A numeric vector representing the initial values of the reduced variables \code{phi_tilde}.}

\item{is}{A numeric vector indicating the nodes with unequal left-hand slope and right-hand slope.}

\item{tau_no_Inf}{A numeric vector containing the unique time points, excluding infinity.}

\item{L_Rc}{Indices of observations where the event is in the intersection of L group and the complement of R group. 
The L group consists of samples with left intervals time <= min(all right intervals time). 
The R group consists of samples with infinity right interval time.}

\item{Lc_R}{Indices of observations where the event is in the intersection of the complement of L group and R group.}

\item{Lc_Rc}{Indices of observations where the event is in the intersection of the complement of L group and the complement of R group.}

\item{ri}{A numeric vector of indices corresponding to the right bounds of the intervals in \code{tau_no_Inf}.}

\item{li}{A numeric vector of indices corresponding to the left bounds of the intervals in \code{tau_no_Inf}.}

\item{weight}{A numeric vector representing the weights for each observation.}

\item{tol}{A numeric value specifying the tolerance for convergence. Default is \code{1e-10}.}

\item{max_iter}{An integer specifying the maximum number of iterations. Default is \code{500}.}

\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{phi_tilde_hat}{The estimated values of the reduced variable \code{phi_tilde} at the end of the ICM iterations.}
}
}
\description{
This function implements the ICM algorithm for solving the sub-problem in the active set algorithm.
This is a support of the active set algorithm, computing the optimal values \code{phi_tilde} with reduced number of knots in the sub-problem.
It uses backtracking to ensure convergence (Jongbloed, 1998).
